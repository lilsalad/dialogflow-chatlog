# dialogflow-chatlog

Dialogflow is a chatbot building framework that helps you build and deploy your own chatbots to multiple platforms like Google Assistant, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Twitter, Slack, Line, Viber and many others.

Using Fulfillment we can communicate with oour server/database to generate dynamic responses. In Fulfillment, we develop a webhook on our server which accepts requests from Dialogflow, processes the request and responds with Dialogflow compatible JSON.

In Dialogflow, a webhook can be used to fetch data from your server whenever a certain intent having webhook enabled is invoked. The information from the intent is passed to the webhook service to receive result. Flask is used to create webhook service which can communicate with external application and Ngrok is a web tunnelling tool that provides a way to test APIs and webhooks from local server from which we can generate our webhook url.

Dialogflow provides an option on the left sidebar known as Fulfillment where we can enter our webhook url generated by ngrok. Now, we can enable the webhook for intents that needs to communicate with our server data. Whenever this intent is invoked, it will send request to our webhook and respond as per the response set from the webhook.
